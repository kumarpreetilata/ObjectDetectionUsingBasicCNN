# ObjectDetectionUsingBasicCNN

Demonstrates how to build a basic CNN for object detection using TensorFlow and Keras. 


#To load an image dataset for training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for object detection, you need to have your images and their corresponding bounding boxes prepared. 
      Images: Store all your images in a folder, e.g., images/.
      Bounding Box Annotations: Create a CSV file (e.g., annotations.csv) where each row contains the image filename and the bounding box coordinates (x, y, width, height)

Load images and annotations, resize images to a fixed size, and normalize the pixel values.
